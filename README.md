# Energy-Generation-Cost-EGC-Model--For-Energy-Generation-Cost-Minimization-using-Linear-Programming
This repository contains a Linear Programming (LP) model designed to minimize energy generation costs while ensuring that electricity demand is met in real-time. The model incorporates renewable energy sources and grid constraints, aiming to optimize the usage of both conventional and renewable generation methods for efficient and sustainable energy management.The goal of this LP model is to minimize the operational costs of energy generation while meeting the electricity demand. The model considers both traditional power plants and renewable energy sources (like wind, solar, and hydro). Additionally, it includes grid constraints such as capacity limits, storage limits, and energy availability from renewable sources, all while ensuring that the electricity supply matches real-time demand.
